# Inox2D: Render WebGL example

![Aka demo picture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13885008/253771145-f3921ffb-6d37-481a-ad26-4a814d070209.png)

## How to build and run

Use [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) to build and run this example.

⚠️ You need to have a puppet file named `puppet.inp` in `examples/render_webgl/assets/` for the project to read. ⚠️

You can get [example models here](https://lunafoxgirlvt.itch.io/inochi-session). They're gonna be in the `.inx` format, so you'll need to convert them to `.inp` by exporting them as puppets from [Inochi Creator](https://lunafoxgirlvt.itch.io/inochi-creator).

```sh
cd examples/render_webgl

# to build
trunk build

# to run directly
trunk serve
```
